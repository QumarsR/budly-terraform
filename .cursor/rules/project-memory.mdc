# Project Memory Management

You have a long-term memory file located at `CURSOR.md` in the .cursor root.

## Your Responsibilities

1.  **Read on Start**: When starting a new task or session that requires architectural context, read `CURSOR.md` to ground yourself in the project's goals and structure.
2.  **Update on Learn**: When you perform deep dives, analyze code, or learn new details about the infrastructure, services, or external dependencies:
    *   Check if this information is missing or outdated in `CURSOR.md`.
    *   Update `CURSOR.md` with the new findings.
3.  **Keep it Concise**:
    *   Do not let the file grow beyond 2-3 pages.
    *   Summarize details. Avoid pasting large code blocks.
    *   Focus on *concepts*, *relationships*, and *decisions*, not line-by-line implementation details.

## Structure of CURSOR.md

- **Overarching Goal**: The "Why" of the project.
- **Architecture & Services**: The "What" and "How" of internal components.
- **Infrastructure**: External pieces (DBs, Frontends) and how they connect.
- **Key Workflows**: Critical paths through the system.
